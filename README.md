## Brain Tumor Detection using Image Segementation
The human brain is the major controller of the humanoid system. The abnormal growth and 
division of cells in the brain lead to a brain tumor, and the further growth of brain tumors 
leads to brain cancer. In the area of human health, Computer Vision plays a significant role, 
which reduces the human judgment that gives accurate results. CT scans, X-Ray, and MRI 
scans are the common imaging methods among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are 
the most reliable and secure. MRI detects every minute objects. Our paper aims to focus on 
the use of different techniques for the discovery of brain cancer using brain MRI. In this 
study, we performed pre-processing using the bilateral filter (BF) for removal of the noises 
that are present in an MR image. This was followed by the binary thresholding and 
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) segmentation techniques for reliable detection of the 
tumor region. Training, testing, and validation datasets are used. Based on our machine, we 
will predict whether the subject has a brain tumor or not. The resultant outcomes will be 
examined through various performance examined metrics that include accuracy, sensitivity, 
and specificity. It is desired that the proposed work would exhibit a more exceptional 
performance over its counterparts.
